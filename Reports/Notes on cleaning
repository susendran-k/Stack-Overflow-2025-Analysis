Imported pandas library and loaded the dataset.
The dataset contains 49191 and 172 rows and columns respectively.

I chosen only essential rows and created a new dataset called df_clean and changed their dtypes to category.
Verified for any null values and find out that 50% of salary was null.

-- To Analyze Tech stack for High package

 Without the language_have_worked and salary column I can't do accurate analysis. So I dropped null values either in salary or language_have_worked columns and created a new dataset df_final! (Only 22121 rows)
 In df_final dataset the maximum salary be 33,552,715 and the minimum be 1$. This result may contain hobbyist and CEO's salary. I can't take those in my analysis.
 So I used a range for salary column and created a dataset df_refined to take for analysis. (the quantile between 0.05 and 0.95)
 Now the salary lies between 3,495 and 232,029 $.

!Task - On Language_have_worked column contains list of languages.
!Solution - I need to split and form kind of tech stack to analyse so I created a new df tech_df focused on Tech stack.

 ---Analysis:
     I've chosen ResponseId, language_have_worked and salary columns to this new tech_df.
     Created a new column Language by splitting the languages which separated by ',' in language_have_worked column.
     Exploded the lists into individual rows.
     Looked for Top 10 languages with popularity and the result be:
         1. JS 2. HTML/CSS 3. SQL 4. Python 5. Shell/Bash 6. TypeScript 7. C# 8. Java 9. PowerShell 10.C++
     Looked for Top 10 High paying Language and the result sounds like 'What???':
         1. Elixir 2.Ruby 3.Perl 4.Swift 5. Groovy 6. Go 7. Bash/Shell 8. PowerShell 9. Rust 10.TypeScript

   --To look for High Paying stack:
     Defined a function categorize_tech() and categorized tech stack with respect to their languages.
     Created a new column Path to categorize tech stack.
     Looked for Top Tech stack by High salary and result be:
       1. Cloud and Devops 2. Other 3. Data & AI 4. Enterprises & Systems 5. Web Development
     But This result doesn't suit for a fresher roadmap. Now I Analysed the results for Salary roadmap by experience and the result be:
       ~For Junior level Web Development has low median salary that mean the fresher for IT chooses the Web Dev stack.
       ~But once the fresher got experience he can move to other stacks that's why the cloud/devops had junior level median salary for $29k.
      **Fact - Entry Level in Cloud/DevOps isn't actually for beginners. Companies usually hire people into DevOps who already have some IT background. **
     Checked for using AI in work helps one to get premium pay and the result was sexpected:
        Yes, Of course! Developers using AI agents earn 16.3% more than those who don't.

Lowercased all column names in all dataset to store these dataset to PgAdmin and to query.
Connected my dataset to my database using sqlalchemy.

Insights on these analysis:

 ~ Popularity != High pay jobs. Popular languages only helps to get into IT but it doesn't helps for high paying roles.
 ~ High paying stack is not for freshers at most case but it for who  have experience in IT fields.
 ~ Once Entering IT with low median salary was common and after only one can switch his stack to get high pay.
 ~ Using AI, really contributes to high pay!
